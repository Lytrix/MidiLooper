## Now implementing

### Overdub-stop MIDI dump during PLAYING

**Now:** Stage 0 remainder DIAG + Stage 1 LoadLoopJob PLAYING admission shipped. Device verify open. Plan: [`overdub_stop_playing_midi_dump_bugfix.md`](../Plans/overdub_stop_playing_midi_dump_bugfix.md). Evidence: [`034408`](../../captures/session_20260813_034408.log) — ~4 s `msi` after OVERDUBBING→PLAYING while `midisvc` is 5–61 ms; dump is catch-up playback, not All Notes Off and not RC-K3.

Do not patch RC-J, start S1, implement observation Gates 0–4, or filter MIDI catch-up. Keep [`TrackDeferredMaintenance.cpp`](../../src/Track/TrackDeferredMaintenance.cpp) out of this work.

### Real-time incremental work (RECORD/OVERDUB) — post–RC-C + S0 timing envelope

**Now: S0e follow-through RC-K1–K3 shipped.** Targeted fix of the overdub note-off cost attributed by S0e. Do not implement admission, change MIDI service density, patch RC-J, or chase overdub display frame-skip. Plan: [`realtime_incremental_work_overdub_note_change_bugfix.md`](../Plans/realtime_incremental_work_overdub_note_change_bugfix.md). Architecture [§31n](../Plans/runtime_scheduling_admission_model_architecture.md#31n-s0e--split-overdub-note-off-path-observation-only) / [§31o](../Plans/runtime_scheduling_admission_model_architecture.md#31o-s0e-follow-through--rc-k1--rc-k2--rc-k3). Evidence: [`204221`](../../captures/session_20260812_204221.log) (`notechg` 274 ms = `noterecon` 177 ms + `notepair` 98 ms).

**Baseline (proof of current stability):** [`191356`](../../captures/session_20260812_191356.log) on `752273d` (RC-H reverted). Multiple overdubs including overdub-over-overdub; display did not freeze (`slice_clean` covers the whole loop after every stop; final STOPPED paints the 16-bar window of a clean 1482-note cache). `clockrate` held **47–48** through PLAYING/OVERDUB (no dropped-clock / half-tempo). `midisvc` did **not** hold: 99–133 ms, then **218–221 ms** on the long overdub, 110–125 ms on later overdubs, against `clk`/`tracks` 4–10 ms. RECORD stays 0.3–0.8 ms. PLAYING↔OVERDUB `msi` spikes 237–433 ms. Post-stop clock drop is RC-J (48→24→0 and 48→36→0) — behind S0b.

**S0e exit:** attributed in [`204221`](../../captures/session_20260812_204221.log) — `usbnote` is `notechg`; `noterecon` 177 ms is quadratic reconstruct dedup; `notepair` 98 ms is the per-candidate `noteIdHasChannel` scan. `noteappend` is 59 µs.

**S1 RC-K1 (shipped):** `reconstructNotesImpl` tracks seen `(note, startTick, endTick)` in an ordered set instead of `std::any_of` over the accepted list. Same key, same insertion order. Native `test_noteutils_reconstruct` PASS including many-identical-geometry collapse.

**S1 RC-K1b (shipped):** the ordered set allocated one PSRAM tree node per note. Boot visual-cache rebuild of 1430 notes measured 1.38 s ([`215128`](../../captures/session_20260812_215128.log) / [`215357`](../../captures/session_20260812_215357.log)). Dedup now ranks into one vector, `qsort`+unique, restore first-seen order. Native `test_noteutils_reconstruct` PASS. `teensy41-capture-serial` fits RAM1.

**S1 RC-K2 (shipped):** `accumulatePendingNoteChangesForIncomingNote` no longer scans source events for channel. Loop notes are loop-scoped (DEC-033). Native `test_pending_shorten_ignores_recorded_channel` PASS.

**S1 RC-K3 (shipped):** `overdubSourceViewNotes_` is reconstructed once in `establishOverdubSourceView` and cleared in `clearOverdubSourceView`. Note-off path and `gatherOverdubSourceViewNotesInWindow` read the member. Native `test_overdub_source_view` PASS.

**S1 RC-K1–K3 verified [`223033`](../../captures/session_20260812_223033.log):** the note-off gate is met — `noterecon` 0 in every window, `notechg` and `notepair` peak at 3.6 ms then hold 0.75–2.0 ms (were 274 / 98 ms).

**S1 RC-L1 (shipped, verified [`225803`](../../captures/session_20260812_225803.log)):** per-span `ProjectedIntervalVec` allocation in `projectDisplayNotes` / `projectNoteIntervals`. Four overdubs on a grown 64-bar loop: `begin_capture` 77 / 80 / 79 / 83 ms (was 1.378 s, and 58 → 410 ms as passes accumulated in [`223033`](../../captures/session_20260812_223033.log)). First USB note 108–242 ms after PLAYING→OVERDUBBING (was 1.76 s). `noterecon` 0; `notechg`/`notepair` 1.09 ms; `usbnote` 1.20 ms; overdub `clockrate` 47–48; overdub `midisvc` 4–14 ms. Remaining ~80 ms is the synchronous gather+reconstruct floor.

**Open after RC-L1 (Option B withdrawn; RC-K3 restored):** Option B native PASS on small loops ([`002329`](../../captures/session_20260813_002329.log)) but grown-loop note-off reconstruct in [`021304`](../../captures/session_20260813_021304.log) was **292 ms per note-off** (`noterecon` 291775 µs, `clockrate` 36). Production overlap is RC-K3 again: `establishOverdubSourceView` runs `gatherCommittedEvents` + `reconstructDisplayNotes` once; `accumulatePendingNoteChangesForIncomingNote` reads `overdubSourceViewNotes_` (no pitch query, no reconstruct on note-off). `gatherCommittedNoteEventsForPitch` stays as a test helper. Playback-observation candidate discovery is designed, not implemented. Do not start S1 / RC-J / Option A / Option C / Option D. Do not optimize Option B further.

**RC-L2 (shipped, device verify open) — pitch-query full-loop copy:** the pairing change had `gatherCommittedNoteEventsForPitch` build a PSRAM `SessionMidiEventVec` of every committed note event per note-off before filtering. [`013917`](../../captures/session_20260813_013917.log) shows `noterecon` 98–191 ms / `notechg` 99–192 ms on 3554 events (`begin_capture` 11 µs, so Option B held). When `collectNoteIdsRetargetedToPitch` returns nothing — always true during plain overdub — the candidate set is exactly the events at that pitch, so the walk filters inline and skips the trailing re-filter. Pairing path unchanged when retargets exist; both branches covered by `test_overdub_source_view`.

**RC-L3 (shipped, HITL verify open) — stored-MIDI verification off the stop path:** `emitStoredMidiVerification` ran inside MIDI button dispatch at overdub stop and cost 342.7 ms / 325.5 ms in [`013917`](../../captures/session_20260813_013917.log) (flush itself under 1 ms): a full `mergeActiveCapturePasses`, one `SEVT` line per note event over 3554 events, the capped wrap-pair scan, then a second full `reconstructNotes` for at most 32 `DNTE` lines. The ring overflowed at both stops, so most `SEVT` lines were dropped and the `seal` / `finalize` / `set_state` stage lines were evicted with them. Now `queueDeferredStoredMidiVerification` only sets a flag; `processDeferredStoredMidiVerification` drains from `processDeferredIdleMaintenance` in 64-event slices (16 while `hasDeferredSaveWork`), flattening once on the first slice and phasing notes → wrap pairs → display notes. Functions are `TRACK_COLD_MEM` — in ITCM they pushed RAM1 past a 32 KB block boundary.

**RC-L3b (shipped, device verify open) — one-shot + idle-only drain:** deferring during PLAYING still blocked MIDI for seconds because the first slice does a full merge ([`020631`](../../captures/session_20260813_020631.log) `msi` 2.95 s). Verification is now **one overdub stop per boot** (`#CAP,DIAG,stored_verify,armed,0` when disarmed; reboot to re-arm for another HITL evidence run). Drain runs only when transport is fully idle (same gate as REVT), not during PLAYING/OVERDUB. Second+ overdub stops in the same session skip verification so manual retests are not penalized.

**Architecture:** [`realtime_incremental_work_capture_overdub_architecture.md`](../Plans/realtime_incremental_work_capture_overdub_architecture.md)  
**Scheduling admission:** [`runtime_scheduling_admission_model_architecture.md`](../Plans/runtime_scheduling_admission_model_architecture.md)  
**S0 (shipped code):** `RuntimeTimingEnvelope` — Tier-A `DIAG,msi` / `midisvc` / `clk` / `tracks` / `clockrate` (5 s); observation only. Native `test_runtime_timing_envelope` PASS.  
**S0 device runs:** [`141815`](../../captures/session_20260812_141815.log), [`144323`](../../captures/session_20260812_144323.log) — envelope lines lost across the whole capture pass; two root causes fixed (see §31a of the scheduling doc):
- **RC-S0a** `isTierATextLine` skipped two commas, so Tier-A classification was inert and the ring evicted every DIAG window. Parse extracted to `CaptureLineTier::isTierALine` (`test_capture_line_tier` PASS); Tier-A may now only be displaced by Tier-A.
- **RC-S0b** `MemoryMonitor::logStatus()` external-pool walk blocked the loop **593 ms** and lost external MIDI clock. Walk is now `setup()`-only (`logStatus(true)`); runtime reports `pool_size` (O(1)). Guide exemption removed.

**S0 run [`145555`](../../captures/session_20260812_145555.log):** envelope survives through RECORD + both overdubs. `midisvc` 0.9–1.1 ms during RECORD vs **129–149 ms** during PLAYING/OVERDUB (762.5 ms at overdub entry), against `clk`/`tracks` ≤ 8.83 ms — MIDI service is the dominant term and clock dispatch is not. **RC-S0c:** windows before 177 s were lost because `flushCaptureBuffer` never transmits Tier-A under the timing-critical budget; fix is a bounded Tier-A transmit allowance (see §31b).  
**Regression vs [`9678c3d`](../Plans/runtime_scheduling_admission_model_architecture.md#31d-regression-vs-9678c3d--display-lag-and-transition-feel):** overdub display lag is the new `resolveDisplayNotesLiveCapture` budget bailout — measured resolve is 23–31 µs·10³ against a 5000 µs budget, so `reuseLastValidFrame` holds a stale frame for most of both overdub passes. Transition feel is the Clock dispatch reorder (Clock no longer transport-first).  
**Shipped (observation only):** compose sub-step instrumentation — `DisplayCommittedRebuildTime`, `DisplayCaptureReplaceTime`, `DisplayCaptureSyncTime`, plus the previously dead `DisplayCaptureGatherTime` / `DisplayCaptureFullGather` slots and branch counters `DisplayCommittedWindowFilter` / `DisplayCommittedFullAssign`. Native 1034/1034; `teensy41-capture-serial` builds.  
**S0 run [`152948`](../../captures/session_20260812_152948.log):** resolve attributed — `rebuildDisplayNotesInWindow` 25.7 ms × 22 calls (the spikes) and `filterDisplayNotesByWindowInclusion` 5.48 ms × 622 calls (the sustained over-budget). `replaceCaptureLayer` 0.10 ms, `synchronizeCaptureLayer` 0.01 ms — not factors. See §31e.  
**RC-D (new, outranks the above):** the OLED repaints every loop iteration — ~14 ms frame period against a 30 ms cadence, ~93 % of loop time in `DisplayManager::update()` from boot. `invalidateProjectedNoteEditDisplayCache` is raised by the general `invalidateLiveDisplayCache` path with no note-edit precondition, but `markNoteEditDisplayPainted` only clears it when `isNoteEditActive()`, so the ungated `maybeUpdateDisplayForNoteEditSelection` path latches on permanently.  
**RC-D fix (shipped):** `markNoteEditDisplayPainted()` now runs unconditionally at the end of the normal paint path in `DisplayManager::update`. Note-edit behaviour unchanged (the guard was already true there). Residual: the load/save overlay branch returns before the ack by design, so the latch can still spin while that overlay is open. Native 1034/1034; `teensy41-capture-serial` builds.  
**RC-D verified [`155132`](../../captures/session_20260812_155132.log):** 32.7 fps (was 70–78); display 45 % of loop time (was ~93 %); idle `msi` 15.3 ms (was ~34 ms); RECORD `midisvc` 604–905 µs. See §31f.
**Still open — dominant path:** `midisvc` 126–146 ms through PLAYING/OVERDUB, unchanged by the display fix. Clock dispatch is ruled out arithmetically (`clk` 4.6 ms would need ~27 pulses per call; the largest `msi` gap in that window buys ~3.5). **S0b — segment `handleMidiInput`** is the next step.
**RC-E fix verified [`165636`](../../captures/session_20260812_165636.log):** `adopt_partial` reports partial coverage and idle slices backfill the whole loop in ~0.6 s (359 → 1 352 notes, then 327 → 1 417). Permanent starvation gone.
**RC-F fix shipped:** clean-cache overdub filter now gathers the paint window widened by `kWindowedGatherMarginBars = 2` and records it — the committed layer follows auto-follow instead of freezing. Verified in [`172405`](../../captures/session_20260812_172405.log): `wNotes` holds at 300–313 across the second overdub.
**RC-F follow-up shipped:** the first fix let the staleness predicate fire during the post-commit dirty window, where every rebuild took the 27.9 ms full-gather branch (30 gathers, 70 of 241 frames over budget, tails on 6 of 241) — that was the bar-boundary stutter and the "notes only appear after a bar". The resolve path no longer gathers: while `visualCacheDirty`, the committed layer is held and recovery is left to `processDeferredIdleMaintenance`; `committedWindowStale` requires a clean cache, and `committedLayerCleanCacheReady` rebuilds once when idle finishes. See §31g-3.
**RC-H reverted (RC-I):** the overdub-stop handoff preserve (`liveOverdubStopHandoffActive_`) pinned the partial adopted frame permanently — [`183429`](../../captures/session_20260812_183429.log): `adopt_partial notes=394`, then `slice_clean notes=1105`, but `DFRAME 394` held from 209.6 s through 214.2 s. The 174843 window content was density-correct; static viewport at STOPPED is expected. Reverted to pre-RC-H behaviour; `preservedHandoffAuthority` covers the ~0.6 s dirty window. **Verified [`191356`](../../captures/session_20260812_191356.log):** no freeze across two overdub clusters; idle `slice_clean` covers the loop; STOPPED paints the 16-bar window of the completed cache.
**RC-J (open, behind S0b):** post-stop persistence stall — `timingCriticalTrackActive` goes false at STOPPED while the external clock still streams. Reproduced in [`191356`](../../captures/session_20260812_191356.log): first stop `clockrate` 48→24→0 `msi` 467 ms; final stop 48→36→0 `msi` 365 ms. Do not patch ad hoc.
**RC-G fix shipped:** `updateOverviewCaptureDensity` builds a per-bar × 8-pitch-band mask incrementally from the capture preview (O(new notes) per frame), and `drawOverviewStrip` renders O(loop bars) from it when no clean `visualCache` exists. Record overview now shows the whole loop. Device verify pending for both.
**Remaining findings:** S0e attributed in [`204221`](../../captures/session_20260812_204221.log): `noterecon` 177 ms (RC-K1), `notepair` 98 ms (RC-K2 / DEC-033), reconstruct-per-note-off (RC-K3). All three firmware stages shipped; device re-measure is the remaining gate. RC-S0c still owed (13 `RING,overflow` in 204221). RC-J not in that log's tail. Display frame-skip / rolling-window during overdub is RC-F follow-up + §31d.
**Overdub display lag:** `DisplayResolveLiveCapture` 33.6 / 33.8 ms during the second overdub against a 5 000 µs budget — the §31d bailout skips `replaceCaptureLayer` and the tails, so live overdub notes are not composed.
**Also open:** display resolve is under budget only by margin — the window filter measures 4 595 µs against a 5 000 µs line, and the gather still peaks at 26.3 ms. A 140 ms post-stop `msi` stall with `midisvc` at ~0.1 ms is uninvestigated.  
**RC-C device:** [`115913`](../../captures/session_20260812_115913.log) — timing PASS; display D1–D2 FAIL.  
**Regression:** [`122003`](../../captures/session_20260812_122003.log) — dual idle slice caused MIDI lag / clock lost (reverted).  
**Now:** Device re-measure after RC-K1b — boot of a 64/66-bar slot must not stall `msi` at 775 ms / 1.38 s `slice_clean`. Then grown-loop overdub vs [`204221`](../../captures/session_20260812_204221.log). Plan [`realtime_incremental_work_overdub_note_change_bugfix.md`](../Plans/realtime_incremental_work_overdub_note_change_bugfix.md). No admission.

### Long record onset display freeze — [`012342`](../../captures/session_20260812_012342.log)

**Plan:** [`long_record_onset_display_freeze_bugfix.md`](../Plans/long_record_onset_display_freeze_bugfix.md) — RC-A shipped; RC-C promoted via architecture doc above.  
**Evidence:** fail [`012342`](../../captures/session_20260812_012342.log); interim PASS [`013747`](../../captures/session_20260812_013747.log).

### Stage 5 — memory / persistence pressure

**5a (closed):** 5a-1/5a-2 shipped; 5a-3 **`pool_alloc` proof abandoned** (2026-08-12).  
**5b:** boot deferred save + clear gating — **parked**.

### Codebase consistency & maintainability — Phase 4 + LR complete

**GitHub:** [#18](https://github.com/Lytrix/MidiLooper/issues/18) · **Plan:** [`codebase_consistency_phase4_extraction_boundaries_refinement.md`](../Plans/codebase_consistency_phase4_extraction_boundaries_refinement.md)  
**Shipped:** TrackManager #22, NoteEditGeometryApply #23, DisplayNoteResolve #24, NoteEditFocus header #25, Phase LR #26. **Next:** close #18; pick next queue item (HITL CLI Phase 3 or persistence — see table below).

### StorageManager TU extraction — shipped (PR #17)

**GitHub:** [#16](https://github.com/Lytrix/MidiLooper/issues/16) — closed · [PR #17](https://github.com/Lytrix/MidiLooper/pull/17) merged to `dev`

### HITL CLI rebuild — Phase 3 (`base` + `edit_full` only)

**OpenSpec:** [`openspec/changes/hitl-cli-rebuild/`](../../openspec/changes/hitl-cli-rebuild/)  
**Plan:** [`docs/Plans/hitl_cli_rebuild_enhancement.md`](../Plans/hitl_cli_rebuild_enhancement.md)

| Phase | Status |
|-------|--------|
| 0–2 — foundation, scenarios | **Done** (2026-08-04) |
| 3 — layered **`base`** + **`edit_full`** | **In progress** — 3.2 bridge stabilized; next: 3.3 device PASS |
| 4–5 — corpus docs, archive | Pending |

**Layered presets (active):** `base` (`record_overdub`), `edit_full`. Do **not** wire `edit_minimal`, `revision_*`, `load_save_*`, `fader_motor_*`, etc. in this change.

**Phase 3 exit:** Mode B device PASS for `--layered --preset base` and `--layered --preset edit_full`.

### Persistence — pick one track (not all parallel)

**Guides:** [`RUNTIME_STORAGE_AND_PERSISTENCE.md`](../Guides/RUNTIME_STORAGE_AND_PERSISTENCE.md) · **Handoffs:** [`set_revision_persistence_handoff.md`](../Plans/set_revision_persistence_handoff.md), [`continuous_runtime_persistence_phase5_recovery_handoff.md`](../Plans/continuous_runtime_persistence_phase5_recovery_handoff.md)  
**Work-queue baseline (shipped):** [`current_set_persist_work_item_queue_enhancement.md`](../Plans/current_set_persist_work_item_queue_enhancement.md)

| Track | OpenSpec / plan | Remaining | When to pick |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|--------------|
| **A — Overlay loop picker** | `set-revision-persistence` §4.8–4.10 | Loop picker UI polish + HITL `set_revision_overlay` | Product overlay milestone |
| **B — Crash recovery** | `continuous-runtime-persistence` Phase 5 | `.sealj` / slot **prefix load**, quarantine tail, native fixtures | After architecture gate; orthogonal to overlay |
| **C — Admit API migration** | [#18](https://github.com/Lytrix/MidiLooper/issues/18) Phase 1.3 | `admitLoopSlotPersist` → `admitLoopPersist(LoopId)` at domain call sites | Hygiene with #18 closeout |
| **D — Parked** | overlay hang, 3.9 failsafe | [`persistence_overlay_large_slot_focus_restore_bugfix.md`](../Plans/persistence_overlay_large_slot_focus_restore_bugfix.md); set-revision §3.9 | Investigation only |

**DeferredJobScheduler Phase B:** **Archived** [`2026-07-19-deferred-job-scheduler`](../../openspec/changes/archive/2026-07-19-deferred-job-scheduler/). Specs: `deferred-job-scheduler/`, `lazy-slot-hydration`.

**DEC-020 note:** Phases 0–4 **shipped** on `dev`. Phase 5 was historically **paused** pending wrap-fix validation — that does not block overlay track A; confirm with user before starting B if wrap HITL is still open (see § Parked wrap investigation below).

## Recently landed on `dev` (pre-queue)

### Bugfix: record-stop MIDI flood — **restore baseline playback, pending HITL**

**Evidence:** [`session_20260713_165557.log`](../../captures/session_20260713_165557.log) — 571 note-ons over 5 pitches in 704 ticks; BPM collapse; `RING,overflow`.

**Fix:** Restored `901c4d9` playback send/anchor (`reanchorPlaybackProjection`, inline `atLoopStart`, `loop.midiEvents()` window). Kept display storage-frame playhead + persistence grace.

**Plan:** [`docs/Plans/record_stop_playback_hang_bugfix.md`](../Plans/record_stop_playback_hang_bugfix.md) (phase 4c)

| Gate | Status |
|------|--------|
| Native | **562/562** |
| `teensy41-capture-serial` build | **SUCCESS** (2026-07-13) |
| HITL / manual | **User** — record→stop→PLAYING; no MO flood; playhead bar 0 |

### Bugfix: record-stop coordinate frame (phase 4) — **superseded by 4c flood fix**

---

### Bugfix: overdub wrap note-off pairing — **implemented, pending HITL**

**Follow-up to capture ownership refactor** ([`overdub_wrap_note_off_pairing_bugfix.md`](../Plans/overdub_wrap_note_off_pairing_bugfix.md)). Fixes wrong on/off pairing when notes are held across loop wrap.

**Changes:** `capturePhaseTick` / `appendCaptureNoteOffAtPhase`; finalize clears pending only after append; canonical `wrappedHeadOff`; stop diagnostics; 13 native tests in `test_capture_note_off_rules`.

| Gate | Status |
|------|--------|
| Native | **554/554** |
| `teensy41-capture-serial` build | **SUCCESS** |
| HITL | **User** — 132536 scenario: tail wrap pairs tail on before wrap, not N@0 |

---

### Bugfix: overdub wrap note-off capture ownership — **implemented, pending HITL**

**Scope:** Single close pipeline for open notes at record/overdub stop; playback read-only (no mid-wrap capture mutation). Aligns live capture with `buildCanonicalSpansFromMidi` wrapped linear storage.

**Changes:**
- Removed `closeOpenNotesAtLoopWrap`, `flushPendingNotesIntoCapture`, `removeCaptureNoteOffAt`
- `finalizePendingNotes(currentTick)` on all record/overdub stop paths (playhead close, not L-1)
- `Loop::sealCapture` passes playhead `openTailCloseTick` to `finalizeWrapWindowOnStore`
- Removed `recordMidiEvents` note-off repair (tick bump, L-1 removal)
- New native suite `test_capture_note_off_rules` (7 tests)

**Plan:** [`docs/Plans/overdub_wrap_note_off_capture_bugfix.md`](../Plans/overdub_wrap_note_off_capture_bugfix.md)

**Deferred:** playback wrap `double_on` ([`session_20260709_224935.log`](../../captures/session_20260709_224935.log)) — separate plan; do not touch `playMidiEventsForSlot` / shared `projectionCycleStartTick`.

| Gate | Status |
|------|--------|
| Native | **554/554** |
| `teensy41-capture-serial` build | **SUCCESS** |
| HITL wrap + capture | **User** — re-run 125437 scenario: balanced SEVT per pitch, no ch4 ghost offs, no lag regression |

---

### Bugfix: loop-wrap playback lag regression — REVERTED to `bc98491` (shipped `901c4d9`)

**Decision:** `19aa47a` ("Fix loop-wrap playback retrigger") and both follow-up wrap-tail rewrites (full-order scan; cursor drain) are **reverted**. `Track::playMidiEvents`, `Track::playMidiEventsForSlot`, `IntervalProjection` (`shouldPlaybackEmitWrapTailEvent` / `shouldPlaybackCrossEvent` helpers), and their tests are restored to `bc98491` — the state the user confirmed "worked perfectly." `closeOpenNotesAtLoopWrap` on overdub playback wrap is restored.

**Proof the wrap fix regressed playback (not the active track):** during the active track's overdub, background **slots** flooded ~1 MO per main-loop frame via `playMidiEventsForSlot`, starving the loop and freezing display ≈2 s ("lag around loop wrap"). MO by channel — good [`session_20260713_115434.log`](../../captures/session_20260713_115434.log) vs bad [`session_20260713_122107.log`](../../captures/session_20260713_122107.log): ch5 (active) 212→223 unchanged; ch4 (slot) 486→**3620**; ch4 ~1 ms-gap events 278→**3422**. `19aa47a` introduced it (ch4 486→2488); cursor drain worsened it (→3622).

**Deferred (not reintroduced yet):** original wrap **double-on** ([`session_20260709_224935.log`](../../captures/session_20260709_224935.log) — MO `double_on` at BAR, 54-bar loop). Any future fix must NOT touch per-frame slot playback / the shared one-per-track `projectionCycleStartTick`.

**Out of scope:** slot/bar queued seek `sendAllNotesOff`; unify pending-note flush at record/overdub stop; stop FSM changes.

| Gate | Status |
|------|--------|
| Native | **542/543** (known empty `test_capture_note_off_rules` suite) |
| `teensy41-capture-serial` build | **SUCCESS** |
| HITL wrap + stop | **User** — compare to 115434: no per-frame slot MO flood, no BAR bunching, no ~120 ms post-stop DISP lag |
