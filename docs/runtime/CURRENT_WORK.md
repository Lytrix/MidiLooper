## Now implementing

### OpenSpec: [`continuous-runtime-persistence`](../../openspec/changes/continuous-runtime-persistence/) (DEC-020)

**Branch:** `continuous-saving` @ `736fa33` (recovery stack merged 2026-07-09)

| Phase | Status |
|-------|--------|
| **0** Diagnostics | **Complete** |
| **1** Chunk lifecycle | **Complete** |
| **2** Persistence queue | **Complete** |
| **3** Cooperative scheduler | **Complete** — overdub-stop HITL passed (`f0ee520`) |
| **4** Mid-pass persistence | **Shipped** — native + **HITL passed** [`session_20260709_171043.log`](../../captures/session_20260709_171043.log) (64+64); boot restore [`session_20260709_171951.log`](../../captures/session_20260709_171951.log) |
| **5** Recovery | **Next** — longest valid prefix load + quarantine tail |
| **6** Full 64+64 HITL | **Mostly evidenced** (same log) — archive checklist + `oldestDirtyChunkAge` review remain |

| Gate | Owner | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| Native | Agent | `pio test -e native` — **540/540** (post-merge) |
| `test_storage_loop_io` | Agent | Run before Phase 4 sign-off |
| Phase 4 HITL (64+64 record/overdub) | **User** | **PASS** — [`session_20260709_171043.log`](../../captures/session_20260709_171043.log): 282× `PERS,mid_pass`, 9× `PERS,result,...,ok`, `freeChunk` 105–136 |
| Phase 4 HITL (cold-boot restore) | **User** | **PASS** — [`session_20260709_171951.log`](../../captures/session_20260709_171951.log): `BOOT,load,ok`, deferred restore slot `4/0`, `DISP` 41472 ticks, playback |
| Phase 5 native fixture | Agent | Partial persisted pass load — not started |

**HITL policy:** stop/crash scenarios — user captures serial manually (`capture_session.py`); agent does not loop HITL. On crash, user bisects and shares log before stop-path patches.

| Doc | Role |

## Parked

### OpenSpec: [`unified-capture-commit-owner`](../../openspec/changes/unified-capture-commit-owner/) (DEC-023)

Phases 1–3 prototype **reverted** at `40db4df` (boot bisect). Storage boot recovery helpers (`37f6b00`) landed. Retry Track/Loop slices only after stable boot + user approval.

### Derived note overlap (`edit-session-action-geometry`)

Blocked until `unified-interval-projection` Phases 1–5 complete.

### Prior: [`runtime-derived-representation-heap`](../../openspec/changes/runtime-derived-representation-heap/)

M5 adopt-on-load shipped; lazy load + 64+64 HITL remain.

## Do not start without decision

- DEC-023 capture-commit Track slices (after Phase 5 or explicit user go)
- `currentset-savedset-storage-layout`
- D13 jam-recording (ROADMAP — post JamRecorder)
