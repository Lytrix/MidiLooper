# Loop Start Editing Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the Loop Start Editing feature, which allows dynamic adjustment of loop start points while maintaining all existing MIDI data and full compatibility with the existing note editing system.

## Feature Requirements Met

✅ **Fader 1 with pitchbend on channel 16** controls loop start point in loop edit mode  
✅ **Exact same logic as select note fader** (16th steps OR note start positions)  
✅ **Grace period** before endpoint updates (1000ms)  
✅ **Endpoint updates based on bars relative to start point**  
✅ **Display updates** - all MIDI events redrawn relative to start point  
✅ **One undo state** - possible to return to original start point  

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Loop Start Point Support in Track Class
- Added `loopStartTick` field to Track class with getter/setter methods
- Implemented combined editing methods: `setLoopStartAndEnd()` and `getLoopEndTick()`
- Added proper reset in track `clear()` method

### Phase 2: Undo Functionality
- Added loop start point undo/redo history fields to Track class
- Implemented `TrackUndo::pushLoopStartSnapshot()`, `undoLoopStart()`, `redoLoopStart()`
- Integrated with existing clear track undo system
- Added loop start history to clear track undo operations

### Phase 3: Fader Handler Implementation
- Added `handleLoopStartFaderInput()` method using same logic as select note fader
- Implemented mode-based routing in `handleMidiPitchbend()`: 
  - Channel 16 → loop start fader in LOOP_EDIT mode
  - Channel 16 → select fader in NOTE_EDIT mode
- Used identical positioning algorithm with note positions + 16th step positions
- Added movement filtering to reduce jitter (12-tick threshold)

### Phase 4: Grace Period and Endpoint Updating
- Added grace period state variables: `loopStartEditingTime`, `loopStartEditingEnabled`, `lastLoopStartEditingActivityTime`
- Implemented 1000ms grace period after loop start changes
- Added `updateLoopEndpointAfterGracePeriod()` method that maintains bar-based loop length
- Integrated grace period handling into main update loop

### Phase 5: Display System Updates
- Modified `tickToScreenX()` to render events relative to loop start point
- Updated `drawPianoRoll()` to adjust playhead cursor and bracket positioning
- Modified `drawAllNotes()` to adjust note positions relative to loop start
- Updated `drawNoteInfo()` to display note positions relative to loop start
- All MIDI events now display correctly relative to the new loop start point

### Phase 6: Note Editing Integration Fixes
- Fixed note selection regression by updating position logic to work with relative positioning
- Updated `handleSelectFaderInput()` to collect note positions relative to loop start
- Fixed `sendTargetPitchbend()` to work with relative positioning
- Updated fader position calculation methods to use relative coordinates
- Fixed missing `enableStartEditing()` call in update loop to re-enable note editing faders

## Technical Details

### Core Algorithm
```cpp
// Convert absolute position to relative
uint32_t relativePos = (absolutePos >= loopStartTick) ? 
    (absolutePos - loopStartTick) : (absolutePos + loopLength - loopStartTick);
relativePos = relativePos % loopLength;
```

### Mode-Based Routing
```cpp
if (channel == 16) {
    if (currentMainEditMode == MAIN_MODE_LOOP_EDIT) {
        handleLoopStartFaderInput(pitchValue, track);
    } else if (currentMainEditMode == MAIN_MODE_NOTE_EDIT) {
        handleSelectFaderInput(pitchValue, track);
    }
}
```

### Grace Period Management
- **Movement threshold**: 12 ticks to reduce jitter
- **Grace period**: 1000ms before endpoint updates
- **Activity tracking**: Updates timestamp on each change
- **Endpoint preservation**: Maintains bar-based loop length

## Issues Resolved

### Initial Compilation Errors
- Fixed missing member variables in header file
- Resolved undefined constants and method references
- Added proper method declarations

### Runtime Issues
1. **Display jittering during movement** - Fixed by adding movement filtering
2. **Loop start offset before notes** - Fixed by removing incorrect double-addition of loop start offset
3. **Note selection regression** - Fixed by updating position logic to work with relative positioning
4. **Bracket positioning bug** - Fixed `drawBracket` to use parameter instead of recalculating
5. **Faders 2,3,4 not working** - Fixed missing `enableStartEditing()` call in update loop

## Key Features Delivered

### User Interface
- **Fader 1**: Controls loop start in LOOP_EDIT mode, note selection in NOTE_EDIT mode
- **Visual feedback**: All elements display relative to loop start point
- **Smooth operation**: Movement filtering prevents jitter
- **Mode awareness**: Automatic routing based on current edit mode

### Technical Implementation
- **Relative coordinate system**: All display and editing functions work with relative positions
- **Grace period**: Prevents accidental endpoint changes during editing
- **Undo system**: Full undo/redo support for loop start changes
- **Compatibility**: Full integration with existing note editing system

### Performance
- **Movement filtering**: 12-tick threshold reduces CPU load
- **Efficient updates**: Only affected elements are redrawn
- **Stable operation**: Grace period prevents rapid endpoint changes

## Documentation Created

- **[LOOP_START_EDITING.md](LOOP_START_EDITING.md)** - Comprehensive technical documentation
- **README.md updates** - Added Loop Start Editing section and feature description
- **Module relationship updates** - Updated documentation tables

## Final State

The implementation successfully provides:
- ✅ Loop start point editing via fader 1 pitchbend in loop edit mode
- ✅ Proper undo/redo functionality with separate history
- ✅ Grace period with automatic endpoint updating
- ✅ Complete display system updates showing events relative to loop start
- ✅ Full compatibility with existing note editing system
- ✅ Smooth operation without jittering or position offset issues
- ✅ Automatic re-enabling of note editing faders after grace period

The system compiles successfully and all requirements have been met. The feature is ready for live performance and studio use, providing powerful loop manipulation capabilities while maintaining full compatibility with existing functionality.
