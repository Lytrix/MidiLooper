# Midi Looper #


![midilooper.jpg](Images/midilooper.jpg)


This Midilooper has been created with help of chatgpt and later Cursor. It has proven to be a great tutor to help me guide and understand every added feature's logic. It saved me a lot of time looking for the correct approach or answers on how to tackle things.

The main inspiration was taken from this minimalistic 4 track looper using only 2 buttons and 4 digits:
https://iestyn-lewis.github.io/4by8/

## Hardware ##
- 1x Teensy 4.1
- 2x momentary button
- 1x 256x64 4bit monochrome display (there is also code for using a liquid lcd display 16x2)
- 1x 6N137

The midi circuit is based on https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_MIDI.html

## Features ##
Multi-track MIDI looper with full undo/redo, auto-save/load, and clear visual feedbackâ€”ready for live performance or creative studio work!

- 4 Midi Tracks
- 192 PPQN internal clock for live recording
- 24 PPQN midi Sync
- 16x2 or graphical information display
- 2 button operation   
- 99 Undos per track (overdub and clear)
- Track clear Undo (restore last cleared track)
- Overdub Undo (revert last overdub layer)
- Automatic saving after each edit (record, overdub, undo, clear) and full recall of your Loops on SD card when powering up.
- Reload last used state and loops on startup
- Robust state machine for all track transitions
- Visual feedback for all actions and states

## ðŸ”´ Button A â€“ Recording, Overdubbing, Playback, Undo, and Clear ##

| Press #     | From State               | To State                 | Symbol Change | Key Action           |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------- | -------------------- |
| 1Ã— (single) | `TRACK_EMPTY`            | `TRACK_RECORDING`        | â€“ â†’ R         | `startRecording()`   |
| (internal)  | `TRACK_RECORDING`        | `TRACK_STOPPED_RECORDING`| (not shown)   | `stopRecording()`    |
| (internal)  | `TRACK_STOPPED_RECORDING`| `TRACK_PLAYING`          | (not shown)   | `startPlaying()`     |
| 1Ã— (single) | `TRACK_PLAYING`          | `TRACK_OVERDUBBING`      | P â†’ O         | `startOverdubbing()` |
| 1Ã— (single) | `TRACK_OVERDUBBING`      | `TRACK_PLAYING`          | O â†’ P         | `stopOverdubbing()`  |
| **Double**  | Any (with undo history)  | No change                | No change     | `undoOverdub()`      |
| Long        | Any (with data)          | `TRACK_EMPTY`            | â†’ â€“           | `clearTrack()`       |


## ðŸ”µ Button B â€“ Track Select, Mute, and Clear Undo ##

|  Press #    | From State         | To State           | Key Action                 |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| 1Ã— (single) | Selected Track     | Select next track  | `setSelectedTrack()`       |
| Long        | Any                | Mute/Unmute        | `toggleMuteTrack()`        |
| **Double**  | Cleared track      | Restore last clear | `undoClearTrack()`         |


- Retroactive bar-quantized recording (record complete bars, but allow earlier recording start)
```
| 1   2   3   4 | 1   2   3   4 |  
          ^ You press record here (beat 3)
                		    	^ You press stop here (beat 4)  

New Loop ready for overdub to add the notes in the first bar.
| 1   2   3   4 | 1   2   3   4 |   
```


## ðŸ”„ Undo/Redo System ##
- **Overdub Undo:** Instantly revert the last overdub layer on any track (Button A double press).
- **Clear Undo:** Restore the last cleared track (Button B double press).
- **Per-track history:** Each track maintains its own undo/redo history for both overdubs and clears.
- **Auto-save:** All changes (record, overdub, undo, clear) are saved to SD card immediately.

## ðŸ”§ Module Relationships and Data Flow ##

| Module         | Key Data                            | Connected Modules             | Purpose                                                                 |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ButtonManager`| Button press type, `millis()`       | `TrackManager`, `ClockManager`| Triggers recording/playback/overdub/mute/clear/undo actions             |
| `TrackManager` | `selectedTrack`, `masterLoopLength` | `Track`, `ClockManager`       | Manages track states and coordination, handles quantized events         |
| `Track`        | `MidiEvent`, `NoteEvent`, `startLoopTick`, `loopLengthTicks` | N/A                        | Stores and manages MIDI/Note data, performs playback and recording      |
| `TrackUndo`    | Undo/redo/clear history per track    | `Track`                       | Manages all undo/redo/clear operations and history for each track       |
| `ClockManager` | `currentTick`                       | All other modules             | Provides global timing for sync and quantization                        |
| `DisplayManager`| â€”                                   | `TrackManager`, `Track`       | Displays NoteEvents, loop status, and other track information           |



## Software development journey ##
Some of the chat can be viewed here of my journey. 
 
MidiLooper (First one. Got really messy with too many workarounds, but with auto load/save functionality from SD)
https://chatgpt.com/share/680a4839-6720-800b-ae73-9aff16f6e41f

MidiLooperV2 (Simpler switch logic for tracks, focussing on workflow logic)
https://chatgpt.com/share/680e999a-c860-800b-a079-9862a59f1e89

MidiLooperV3 (Started off from a framework in C++, hope it will be more stable to use)
https://chatgpt.com/share/680e98f9-2a64-800b-abb2-4e1bd359c90f

Developing the SSD1322 circular DMA logic was a lot of fun using Cursor. It was really helpfull to have an LLM model explain someone elses 2000+ lines of code in how the logic worked I wanted to port to this display.
