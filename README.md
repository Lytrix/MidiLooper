# Midi Looper #
![midilooper.jpg](Images/midilooper.jpg)

This Midilooper has been created with help of chatgpt and later Cursor. It has proven to be a great tutor to help me guide and understand every added feature's logic. It saved me a lot of time looking for the correct approach or answers on how to tackle things.

The main inspiration was taken from this minimalistic 4 track looper using only 2 buttons and 4 digits:
https://iestyn-lewis.github.io/4by8/

## Hardware ##
- 1x Teensy 4.1
- 2x momentary buttons
- 1x encoder with push button
- 1x 256x64 4bit monochrome display type [NHD-3.12-25664UCY2](https://nl.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Newhaven-Display/NHD-3.12-25664UCY2?qs=EQmeiuRlVUSdkL9ZYPHyoA%3D%3D) (there is also code for using a liquid lcd display 16x2)
- 1x 6N137

The midi circuit is based on https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_MIDI.html

## Installation ##
The project uses a modified [SSD1322 library](https://github.com/Lytrix/SSD1322_OLED_Arduino_library/tree/develop/) adding TsyDMASPI to be able to reduce CPU usage running via DMA. To add it use this command when cloning the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/Lytrix/MidiLooper.git --recurse-submodules`


## Features ##
Multi-track MIDI looper with full undo/redo, auto-save/load, and clear visual feedback‚Äîready for live performance or creative studio work!

- 4 Midi Tracks
- 192 PPQN internal clock for live recording
- 24 PPQN midi Sync
- 256x64 display and 16x2 display driver
- 2 button operation   
- 99 Undos per track (overdub and clear)
- Track clear Undo (restore last cleared track)
- Overdub Undo (revert last overdub layer)
- **Loop Start Point Editing** (dynamic loop start position control with fader)
- **Loop Length Editing** (1-128 bars with CC control and automatic fader feedback)
- **Note Length Editing Mode** (toggle between position and length editing for notes)
- Automatic saving after each edit (record, overdub, undo, clear) and full recall of your Loops on SD card when powering up.
- Reload last used state and loops on startup
- Robust state machine for all track transitions
- Visual feedback for all actions and states on both displays
- 256x64 OLED display with piano roll visualization
- 16x2 LCD display with essential info
- SD card storage for loop data

- Multi-layer overdubbing with separate undo states
- Track muting and solo functionality
- Automatic loop synchronization
- Motorized fader support with feedback prevention
- Dedicated edit modes for different operations
- Full wrap-around support for notes crossing loop boundaries

## ‚úèÔ∏è Note Editor ##
- Piano-roll note editor integrated into the looper UI
- Encoder-driven movement of note start positions, with seamless wrap-around support
- Raw note end tick stored intact; wrapping logic is deferred to display and playback layers
- Intelligent overlap resolution:
  - Left-to-right moves delete overlapping notes
  - Right-to-left moves shorten overlapping notes (down to a 1/16th-step) and delete if too short
  - Direction-aware restoration of previously deleted or shortened notes when moving away
- Selection bracket and highlight visually track the moving note
- Host-side unit tests in `test/` to validate wrap logic and edit behavior

## üîÑ Loop Start Point Editing ##
- **Dynamic loop start control** via Fader 1 (Pitchbend Channel 16) in LOOP_EDIT mode
- **Same positioning logic as note select fader** - uses note start positions OR 16th-note step positions for precise control
- **1000ms grace period** before automatic endpoint adjustment to prevent unwanted changes during movement
- **Automatic endpoint updating** maintains bar-based loop length relative to new start point
- **Complete display system integration** - all MIDI events, cursor, and bracket adjust to show content relative to loop start
- **Full undo/redo support** - single undo state allows return to original loop start point
- **Seamless integration** with existing note editing system - all faders work correctly with relative positioning

## üéõÔ∏è Loop Length Editing ##
- **Dynamic loop length control** via CC 101 on Channel 16 in LOOP_EDIT mode
- **Bar-based editing** - maps CC values (0-127) to loop lengths (1-128 bars)
  - CC 0 = 1 bar
  - CC 127 = 128 bars
  - Linear scaling between these values
- **Non-destructive editing** - preserves all existing MIDI events when changing loop length
- **Automatic fader feedback** - sends current loop length back to controller when switching tracks or entering LOOP_EDIT mode
- **Real-time display updates** - piano roll and timing display adjust automatically to new loop length
- **Track-specific lengths** - each track can have its own loop length independent of others

## üìè Note Length Editing Mode ##
- **Toggle between position and length editing** via Note 3 on Channel 16 (momentary button)
- **Two distinct editing modes**:
  - **Position Edit Mode** (default): Faders 1, 2, 3 control note START positions
  - **Length Edit Mode**: Faders 1, 2, 3 control note END positions (length editing)
- **Seamless mode switching** with automatic fader position updates
- **Visual feedback** - console logs clearly indicate which mode is active
- **Integrated with all fader controls**:
  - Fader 1: Note selection (works in both modes)
  - Fader 2: Coarse position control (16th-note steps)
  - Fader 3: Fine position control (tick-level precision)
- **Minimum length enforcement** - prevents notes from becoming shorter than 1/16th note
- **Wrap-around support** - note lengths can extend across loop boundaries

```


## üîÑ Undo/Redo System ##

The looper provides comprehensive undo/redo functionality for both overdub and clear operations:

- **Per-track history:** Each track maintains its own undo/redo history for both overdubs and clears.
- **Automatic snapshots:** Undo snapshots are automatically created before overdubs, edits, and clears.
- **Hash-based optimization:** Edit operations that result in no net changes automatically discard their undo snapshots.
- **Triple press redo:** Redo functionality is accessed via triple press on buttons A and B.

### Button Controls:
- **Button A Double Press:** Undo last overdub operation
- **Button A Triple Press:** Redo last undone overdub operation  
- **Button B Double Press:** Undo last clear operation
- **Button B Triple Press:** Redo last undone clear operation

### Technical Details:
- Undo history is preserved across sessions via SD card storage
- Redo history is cleared when new operations are performed (standard behavior)
- Maximum undo history is configurable via `Config::MAX_UNDO_HISTORY`
- Both physical buttons and MIDI buttons support the same undo/redo controls

## Software development journey ##
Some of the chat can be viewed here of my journey. 
 
MidiLooper (First one. Got really messy with too many workarounds, but with auto load/save functionality from SD)
https://chatgpt.com/share/680a4839-6720-800b-ae73-9aff16f6e41f

MidiLooperV2 (Simpler switch logic for tracks, focussing on workflow logic)
https://chatgpt.com/share/680e999a-c860-800b-a079-9862a59f1e89

MidiLooperV3 (Started off from a framework in C++, hope it will be more stable to use)
https://chatgpt.com/share/680e98f9-2a64-800b-abb2-4e1bd359c90f

Developing the SSD1322 circular DMA logic was a lot of fun using Cursor. It was really helpfull to have an LLM model explain someone elses 2000+ lines of code in how the logic worked I wanted to port to this display.
