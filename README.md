# Midi Looper #


This Midilooper has been created with help of chatgpt. It has proven to be a great tutor to help me guide and understand every added feature's logic. It saved me a lot of time looking for the correct approach or answers on how to tackle things.

The main inspiration was taken from this minimalistic 4 track looper using only 2 buttons and 4 digits:
