# Midi Looper #


This Midilooper has been created with help of chatgpt. It has proven to be a great tutor to help me guide and understand every added feature's logic. It saved me a lot of time looking for the correct approach or answers on how to tackle things.

The main inspiration was taken from this minimalistic 4 track looper using only 2 buttons and 4 digits:

## Software ##
The chat can be viewed here of my journey. 
 
MidiLooper (First one. Got really messy with too many workarounds, but with auto load/save functionality from SD)

MidiLooperV2 (Simpler switch logic for tracks, focussing on workflow logic)

MidiLooperV3 (Started off from a framework in C++, hope it will be more stable to use)
