# Midi Looper #


![midilooper.jpg](Images/midilooper.jpg)


This Midilooper has been created with help of chatgpt. It has proven to be a great tutor to help me guide and understand every added feature's logic. It saved me a lot of time looking for the correct approach or answers on how to tackle things.

The main inspiration was taken from this minimalistic 4 track looper using only 2 buttons and 4 digits:

## Software ##
The chat can be viewed here of my journey. 
 
MidiLooper (First one. Got really messy with too many workarounds, but with auto load/save functionality from SD)

MidiLooperV2 (Simpler switch logic for tracks, focussing on workflow logic)

MidiLooperV3 (Started off from a framework in C++, hope it will be more stable to use)

- Retroactive bar-quantized recording (record complete bars, but allow earlier recording start)
```
| 1   2   3   4 | 1   2   3   4 |  
          ^ You press record here (beat 3)
                		    	^ You press stop here (beat 4)

```


## ðŸ”§ Module Relationships and Data Flow ##

| Module         | Key Data                            | Connected Modules             | Purpose                                                                 |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ButtonManager`| Button press type, `millis()`       | `TrackManager`, `ClockManager`| Triggers recording/playback/overdub/mute/clear actions                 |
| `TrackManager` | `selectedTrack`, `masterLoopLength` | `Track`, `ClockManager`       | Manages track states and coordination, handles quantized events        |
| `Track`        | `MidiEvent`, `NoteEvent`, `startLoopTick`, `loopLengthTicks` | N/A                        | Stores and manages MIDI/Note data, performs playback and recording     |
| `ClockManager` | `currentTick`                       | All other modules             | Provides global timing for sync and quantization                       |
| `DisplayManager`| â€”                                   | `TrackManager`, `Track`       | Displays NoteEvents, loop status, and other track information          |
