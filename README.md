# Midi Looper #
![midilooper.jpg](Images/midilooper.jpg)

This Midilooper has been created with help of chatgpt and later Cursor. It has proven to be a great tutor to help me guide and understand every added feature's logic. It saved me a lot of time looking for the correct approach or answers on how to tackle things.

The main inspiration was taken from this minimalistic 4 track looper using only 2 buttons and 4 digits:
https://iestyn-lewis.github.io/4by8/

## Hardware ##
- 1x Teensy 4.1
- 2x momentary buttons
- 1x encoder with push button
- 1x 256x64 4bit monochrome display type [NHD-3.12-25664UCY2](https://nl.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Newhaven-Display/NHD-3.12-25664UCY2?qs=EQmeiuRlVUSdkL9ZYPHyoA%3D%3D) (there is also code for using a liquid lcd display 16x2)
- 1x 6N137

The midi circuit is based on https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_MIDI.html

## Installation ##
The project uses a modified [SSD1322 library](https://github.com/Lytrix/SSD1322_OLED_Arduino_library/tree/develop/) adding TsyDMASPI to be able to reduce CPU usage running via DMA. To add it use this command when cloning the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/Lytrix/MidiLooper.git --recurse-submodules`


## Features ##
Multi-track MIDI looper with full undo/redo, auto-save/load, and clear visual feedback‚Äîready for live performance or creative studio work!

- 4 Midi Tracks
- 192 PPQN internal clock for live recording
- 24 PPQN midi Sync
- 256x64 display and 16x2 display driver
- 2 button operation   
- 99 Undos per track (overdub and clear)
- Track clear Undo (restore last cleared track)
- Overdub Undo (revert last overdub layer)
- Automatic saving after each edit (record, overdub, undo, clear) and full recall of your Loops on SD card when powering up.
- Reload last used state and loops on startup
- Robust state machine for all track transitions
- Visual feedback for all actions and states

## ‚úèÔ∏è Note Editor ##
- Piano-roll note editor integrated into the looper UI
- Encoder-driven movement of note start positions, with seamless wrap-around support
- Raw note end tick stored intact; wrapping logic is deferred to display and playback layers
- Intelligent overlap resolution:
  - Left-to-right moves delete overlapping notes
  - Right-to-left moves shorten overlapping notes (down to a 1/16th-step) and delete if too short
  - Direction-aware restoration of previously deleted or shortened notes when moving away
- Selection bracket and highlight visually track the moving note
- Host-side unit tests in `test/` to validate wrap logic and edit behavior

## üî¥ Button A ‚Äì Recording, Overdubbing, Playback, Undo, and Clear ##

## üîµ Button B ‚Äì Track Select, Mute, and Clear Undo ##

|  Press #    | From State         | To State           | Key Action                 |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| 1√ó (single) | Selected Track     | Select next track  | `setSelectedTrack()`       |
| Long        | Any                | Mute/Unmute        | `toggleMuteTrack()`        |
| **Double**  | Cleared track      | Restore last clear | `undoClearTrack()`         |


- Retroactive bar-quantized recording (record complete bars, but allow earlier recording start)
```
| 1   2   3   4 | 1   2   3   4 |  
          ^ You press record here (beat 3)
                		    	^ You press stop here (beat 4)  

New Loop ready for overdub to add the notes in the first bar.
| 1   2   3   4 | 1   2   3   4 |   
```


## üîÑ Undo/Redo System ##
- **Overdub Undo:** Instantly revert the last overdub layer on any track (Button A double press).
- **Clear Undo:** Restore the last cleared track (Button B double press).
- **Per-track history:** Each track maintains its own undo/redo history for both overdubs and clears.
- **Auto-save:** All changes (record, overdub, undo, clear) are saved to SD card immediately.

## Software development journey ##
Some of the chat can be viewed here of my journey. 
 
MidiLooper (First one. Got really messy with too many workarounds, but with auto load/save functionality from SD)
https://chatgpt.com/share/680a4839-6720-800b-ae73-9aff16f6e41f

MidiLooperV2 (Simpler switch logic for tracks, focussing on workflow logic)
https://chatgpt.com/share/680e999a-c860-800b-a079-9862a59f1e89

MidiLooperV3 (Started off from a framework in C++, hope it will be more stable to use)
https://chatgpt.com/share/680e98f9-2a64-800b-abb2-4e1bd359c90f

Developing the SSD1322 circular DMA logic was a lot of fun using Cursor. It was really helpfull to have an LLM model explain someone elses 2000+ lines of code in how the logic worked I wanted to port to this display.
