## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: On-demand deferred slot load priorities

After interactive ready, deferred slot load SHALL honor only:

1. Audible slots still needing Commit (normally empty after boot)
2. Explicitly requested slots (select, focus, or equivalent user/request path)

The system SHALL NOT implement unbounded speculative fill without priority. Background fill SHALL use focus-adjacent then focus-track then forward-track ordering (`computeDeferredRestorePriority`).

#### Scenario: Select unloaded slot while stopped

- **WHEN** the user selects an unloaded SD slot while transport is idle
- **THEN** the system requests deferred load for that slot
- **AND** the slot reaches COMMITTED without reboot
- **AND** display MAY paint from committed passes

The system SHALL background-fill remaining HEADER_READY SD payloads after interactive ready, ordered by:

1. Focus selected slot
2. Left and right neighbors on the focus track (wrap)
3. Other slots on the focus track
4. Other tracks in forward cycle order from the selected track

While any track is recording or overdubbing, the system MAY queue an explicit slot-load request and SHALL defer SD load work until capture is idle.

After interactive ready, deferred restores SHALL proceed as deferred job steps (`LoadLoopJob`) executed through `DeferredJobScheduler::runFrame`: SD payload bytes MAY be read in chunks across multiple main-loop iterations, then parsed under a time budget, then Committed by `StorageManager`. Parse SHALL be time-sliced; finalize / commit-id headroom SHALL NOT walk the PSRAM pool via `sm_malloc_stats_pool`. Loop length SHALL NOT gate whether a slot may restore while PLAYING.

Focus High `LoadLoopJob` work (focused / explicitly requested slot) SHALL advance while a track is PLAYING. Background Low `LoadLoopJob` work SHALL be skipped while any track is PLAYING (`canRunBackgroundLoadLoopNow`); skipped frames SHALL leave active/parked/queue progress intact. Device gate evidence: PASS on `session_20260718_224607.log` and A.7 confirm on `session_20260718_230145.log`.

#### Scenario: Select unloaded during PLAYING hydrates via deferred job steps

- **WHEN** the user selects an unloaded slot while a track is PLAYING (no record/overdub)
- **THEN** the load request is retained and remaining payloads are enqueued for priority fill
- **AND** focus High `LoadLoopJob` for that slot MAY advance one chunk (or parse/commit) per `DeferredJobScheduler::runFrame` while PLAYING
- **AND** background Low `LoadLoopJob` fill does not advance while any track is PLAYING (`canRunBackgroundLoadLoopNow`)
- **AND** display MAY update from COMMITTED passes without requiring transport stop

#### Scenario: Select unloaded during RECORDING defers

- **WHEN** the user selects an unloaded slot while any track is RECORDING or OVERDUBBING
- **THEN** the load request is retained
- **AND** SD restore for that slot does not run until capture is idle
